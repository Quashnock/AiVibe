# AiVibe

## Description

This project is my final open-ended project in the Codecademy Frontend Career Path certification. In this project I wanted to challenge myself in both design and implementation complexity by creating a unique look for the website while implementing both the Google Gemini AI API and the Spotify API. The idea for this project came to me while on a walk where I found myself looking on YouTube to find and make a playlist fitting the vibe of the walk I was on.

## Features
This project first requires you to login with your spotify account to authorize it to make a playlist. From there you can enter a vibe for your playlist into the prompt bar or choose one of the AI suggested prompts. The app will then generate a list of songs that link directly to the song, artist/s and album on spotify. Finally, you can then create a Spotify playlist of these songs by pressing the "Add to Playlist" button at the bottom of the song list.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux
- Netlify
- Google Gemini API
- Spotify API

## Credits
### Logos / Icons:
- Spotify logo by [Pictogrammers](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign)
- Music Favicon by [Phosphor Icons](https://github.com/phosphor-icons/core)
- Up Arrow icon by [HeskeyBaozi](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-icons)
### Spotify PKCE Authorization Code
The approach for getting and handling Spotify token authorization was based off of the [template](https://github.com/spotify/web-api-examples/tree/master/authorization/authorization_code_pkce) created by GitHub user [alnacle](https://github.com/alnacle)

## Future Work
Allow users to manually search for songs and add them to the playlist
